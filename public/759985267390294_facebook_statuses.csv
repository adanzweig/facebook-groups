Please view the current landing page to get an idea of how it will work when the software is done, and/or read below. https://logodrops.com/

I'm working on an online logo maker where you can get a logo made in just a couple minutes. Select a style, choose your colors, describe what your business is about or does and *poof*, you get 20 logos delivered to your screen in seconds.
You then get the option to generate more logos, or.. select a logo and modify the font, colors, symbol or layout. Simple, yet professional looking logos. No templates but a mix of symbols, shapes, monograms and fonts.

Once you're happy with the result you can purchase all the source files (vector/svg) plus other assets such as a reversed colored version, templates for business cards or for your social media pages.

Any suggestions for the LP or how the software will work?

I'm cautiously trying the app on my macbook, and wondering if after importing a photo to Apple Photos, I can delete the original file without worrying about any data loss (such as unwanted resizing, etc). For testing, I was comparing the size of original photo vs photo that was imported to Photos and pulled back to Finder (drag & drop), and right now I'm thinking the difference (79 bytes out of 1.4 MB total size) might be coming from name change (to prevent duplicates, the second file was automatically re-named 'original 2.jpg'), but what else could be happening behind the scenes?",SoYoung Park,,status,,2017-04-11 05:43:48,1,6,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
